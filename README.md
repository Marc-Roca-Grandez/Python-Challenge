# Python-Challenge
This challenge consisted of two files in which we needed to extract the data. 
The first exercise was the PyBank where we got a file in which we needed to extract data of profit and loss in different times. We needed to determine which of the dates had the biggest increase and decrease in profits and how these numbers varied per day.

The second exercise was the PyPoll where we got a file in which we needed to extract data of an election. We needed to give out the sumary of what happened. The total votes, the candidates and the votes they won, and the winner of the election.
